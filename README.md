## 📸 Powered by Framer Motion

This project leverages **Framer Motion** to create smooth, scroll-based animations such as:

* ✨ **Scroll-triggered parallax** elements in Hero and Product sections

Animations are tightly integrated with `useScroll` and `useTransform` hooks to ensure performance and interactivity.
